    <h2>Welcome to bee-friendly gardening!</h2>

    <p>If you're like many homeowners today, you're interested in beautifying your 
      garden with fewer chemicals and more diverse plants. The great news is it's never 
      been easier to introduce hearty, native plants into your own yard.</p>

    <p>If you're planning garden updates, you probably know pollinators play an important 
      role in the health and beauty of the plants you choose. Honey bees around the world are 
      dying off at alarming rates, but you can help them by choosing indigenous plants. Since these 
      plants grow in your region anyway, they're great natural food sources for bees.</p>

    <p>It doesn't take any extra work on your part to help bees and other pollinators. In fact, 
      native plants use less water and are more climate tolerant. The fascinating bees, butterflies, 
      and birds they attract are a beautiful bonus Mother Nature throws in free of charge!</p>

    <p>Bee-Z Street is designed to help you choose easy-care native plants that brighten and beautify 
      your home landscaping. We think you'll love the results; the bees will thank you too!</p>
